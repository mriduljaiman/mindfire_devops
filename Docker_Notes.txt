1. WHAT IS DOCKER?
Docker is a containerization tool.
It runs applications in isolated containers.
Main idea: Build once, run anywhere.

2. VM VS CONTAINER
VM has full OS, heavy, slow.
Container shares host OS, lightweight, fast.

3. IMAGE VS CONTAINER
Image = blueprint (read-only)
Container = running image (writable)

Rule: Image + Run = Container

4. DOCKER ARCHITECTURE
Docker CLI → Docker Daemon → Registry

5. DOCKERFILE
Text file to build image.
FROM, RUN, COPY, CMD, ENTRYPOINT

6. CMD VS ENTRYPOINT
CMD = default command (override possible)
ENTRYPOINT = fixed command
Best practice: ENTRYPOINT + CMD

7. docker build
docker build -t myapp .
. = build context (current directory)

8. IMAGE COMMANDS
docker images
docker pull
docker push
docker rmi
docker tag
docker inspect
docker history

9. CONTAINER COMMANDS
docker run
docker ps / docker ps -a
docker stop / start / restart
docker rm
docker logs
docker exec
docker inspect

10. VOLUMES
Volumes store data outside container.
Mandatory for databases.

11. VOLUME COMMANDS
docker volume ls
docker volume create
docker volume inspect
docker volume rm

12. NETWORKING
bridge, host, none
Containers talk using names.

13. PORT MAPPING
-p host:container

14. DOCKER COMPOSE
docker-compose up
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose down
docker-compose down -v

15. MICROSERVICES
Each service in separate container.
Use service names, not IPs.

16. IMAGE TAGGING
Never use latest in production.
Use semantic versions.

17. PRIVATE REGISTRY
Stores private company images.

18. IMAGE SCANNING
Trivy, Anchore

19. ROOTLESS DOCKER
Runs Docker without root.

20. IMAGE SIGNING
Cosign ensures image integrity.

21. SBOM
List of all libraries inside image.

22. COMMON FAILURES
No volume for DB
Using latest
No restart policy
Disk full

23. GOLDEN RULES
Containers are temporary
Images are immutable
Volumes are permanent
